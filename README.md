### Introduction:
      Argus, with Chinese name "神龙小助手" is a light tool "sliding" on Android machines, which we can exploit to fast access 
      into apps already installed and handle gadgets such as wifi and bluetooth's switches.
      That being said, he is still a growing kid.  We need your help !
